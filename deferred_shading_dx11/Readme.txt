Deferred Shading Demo
=====================

This application demonstrates several deferred shading algorithms.


User Interaction
================

- As with other DXSDK samples, use WASD with the mouse (click and drag) to fly
  around the scene.


Requirements
============

For compilation:

1) Visual C++ 2010
2) DirectX SDK (June 2010 or newer)

For execution:

1) Windows Vista or Windows 7
2) DirectX 11 compatible video card
3) Appropriate Visual C++ Redistributable Package (2010)


Known Issues
============
   
1) Output is corrupted on NVIDIA DX11 cards when using the "Quad" deferred
   shading technique. This appears to be a bug in the shader compiler.
   At the time of writing, commenting out the branch on mUI.visualizeLightCount
   (and body) in the GPUQuad function in GPUQuad.hlsl works around the issue.
